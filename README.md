# OSSF Scorecard Visualizer

The OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor Visualizer is a tool that provides a visual representation of the OpenSSF Scorecard data for monitoring the security status of open source projects. It fetches the scorecard data from the [OpenSSF Scorecard API](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/#/results) and presents it in a user-friendly and interactive visual format.

The Visualizer is part of the [OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/openssf-scorecard-monitor), where you can access to the features.

## Features

### Scorecard Data Visualizer

Display the OpenSSF Scorecard data in a visual format for easy understanding and analysis.

### Scorecard Data Comparator

Compare between two commits that reported Scorecard data. See how the scores changed and further details.

### Scorecard Data Comparator Diff

Makes easier the visualization of the differences in the Scorecard comparator reasoning and details.

    </div>

### Support to GitLab repositories

The project provides support of visualization and diff comparation for GitLab projects. In the GitLab version, deps.dev and step security links are not included, as those platforms don't support GitLab projects yet.

### Discrepancies management

The Scorecard API can provide discrepancies in the data while comparing between two commits due [technical reasons](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/3438). The visualizer provides a way to showcase the discrepancies found.

## How to use it

The Visualizer and the Comparator can be used outside the Monitor.

You have 3 options of visualization. Depending on which one you want to check, you should craft your own url as:

- Checks the latest Scorecard data available for a project: `https://ossf.github.io/scorecard-visualizer/#/projects/${platform}/${org}/${repo}`
- Checks the Scorecard data for an specific commit (previously reported): `https://ossf.github.io/scorecard-visualizer/#/projects/${platform}/${org}/${repo}/commit/{commitHash}`
- Compares two specific commits, previously reported: `https://ossf.github.io/scorecard-visualizer/#/projects/github.com/nodejs/node/compare/{prevCommitHash}/{currentCommitHash}`

> ðŸ‘‰ Please note that in order to retrieve data from the Scorecard API, it is necessary for organizations or repository owners to report their commits to the Scorecard. However, it's important to keep in mind that not all organizations report their commits, which may result in a `404 error` if the data is not available in the API. Please be aware that this behavior is expected and not indicative of a bug.
